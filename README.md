### Related Paper
A paper corresponding to this implementation was presented at the International Conference on Field-Programmable Technology (FPT'21) and is publicly available at [ePrint](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1451.pdf) and [IEEE FPT](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9609917).

## Details

### `KAT`, `rtl_src`, `rtl_tb`
This repository contains a high performance FPGA implementation of the Dilithium PQC signature algorithm written in Verilog. It contains a top module, "combined_top" which supports the operations of key generation, sign, and verify for security levels 2, 3, and 5. The three associated test benches show how to operate the module for each of these operation modes.

The design was verified in simulation using the standard 100 KATs generated by the reference implementation.

### `dilithium-256`

This folder contain the high level code that emulates NTT design. The implementation of NTT-2x2 are in both software, and hardware fashion. 
This code is improved upon previous works [17,18] in the paper.
